# squattydent/feedback

A repository to ask [@squattydent](https://twitter.com/DeveloperUI) anything.

I [worked at Andalas Lintas Data ](https://github.com/AndalasLintasData) since early 2017. If you have a question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just the joint for you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/squattydent/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/kidigo/feedback/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@DeveloperUI](https://twitter.com/DeveloperUI) on
Twitter.
